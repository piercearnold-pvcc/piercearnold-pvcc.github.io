    <h2> Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing </h2>
    <table>
        <td>Phases of computer program development:
        <ul>
            <li>Pahse 1: Understanding the problem</li>
            <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
            <li>Phase 3: Write the program and code in approprate language based on the algorithm</li>
            <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
            <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
            <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, the retest</li>
            <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
        </ul>
        Programming structures:
        <ul>
          <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
          <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
          <li>Interactive (looping):
            <ul>
                <li>while loop: continue looping as long as something is true</li>
                <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Recursive structures:
            <ul>
                <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
                <li>Repitition continues until: degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met (degenerative case is also called a "base case")</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Two classic programming/database problems
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                    <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria
                <ul>
                    <li>In database:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                            <li>queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Two popular search techniques:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
                    <li>Binary search:
                        <ul>
                            <li>only works if data is SORTED first</li>
                            <li>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Two classic program goals:
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
            <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
        </ul>
        Software testing and verifacation
        <ul>
            <li>Kinds of tests:
                <ul>
