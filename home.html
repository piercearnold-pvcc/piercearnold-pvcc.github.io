            <td>The 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution states “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, 
                nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted” and was part of the first ten amendments to the Constitution which are known as the Bill of Rights. 
                The primary purpose of this amendment was to protect criminals and those criminally charged from governmental oppression. While it is generally
                true that punishment should scale with both the offender and the offense, this amendment prohibits any punishment, fine, or bail growing so 
                large as to be oppressive.

                Excessive Bail:
                <br>
                <br>
                A bail is money paid by a defendant (someone accused of a crime) to the court as a security measure that will be paid back after the case ends
                assuming the defendant behaved according to court orders. This is instituted primarily for defendants the court is worried will run away or
                commit further crimes in order to get out of a conviction. However the United States has an innocent until proven guilty court system, hence
                the institution of the 8th Amendment, preventing any excessive fine or bail from being formed. Because of the ever changing nature of our
                country, what exact number that is deemed as excessive changes between time, individual, and crime committed. As an example of this the
                Supreme Court found $50,000 bail to be excessive in Stack v. Boyle because of the defendant's limited resource and the lack of evidence
                that they were at risk of fleeing. And in United States v. Slaerno they stated that the bail is only there to assure that the defendant
                will stand at trial and submit to sentence if found guilty, and courts should choose the absolute minimum amount of money required in
                order to achieve that goal.

                Excessive Fines:
                <br>
                <br>
                For a lengthy period of time the Supreme Court had little to say on the matter of excessive fines, in 1998 it gave some real guidelines
                to protect the convicts of the United States. They stated “The touchstone of the constitutional inquirey under the excessive fines clause
                is the principal of proportionality: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is
                designed to punish.” And in United States v. Bajakajian, a case of over $10,000 being smuggled out of the country, the Court found that
                fines totaling $375,144 were excessive as they were not measured in proportion to the crime. According to the Supreme Court, determining
                what is correctly proportional depends on the crime, the particular facts of the case, the character of the defendant, and the harm
                that the defendant caused.

                Cruel and Unusual Punishment:
                <br>
                <br>
                The Supreme Court began to consider whether the standard of cruel and unusual punishments could change with time as the twentieth century drew near.
                In 1878 they continued to use the standard of what the Framers of 1789 would have found cruel or unusual. However by 1910 the Court deemed that this
                portion of the 8th Amendment was meant to evolve with society and time, changing along side a culture that learns as it grows. One of the biggest
                areas in which the 8th amendment is applied in physical penalties and the death penalty. The Court deems that punishments should not involve
                unnecessary pain, but deemed in 1890 that the death penalty in itself is not cruel, only torture or lingering death methods. The existence of the
                death penalty itself is probably the most heavily debated aspect of the 8th Amendment, and there are advocates on both sides, with the Supreme
                Court's current position being that while it can exist, there are narrow guidelines that define what defendants are death-eligible. As of July of 2022
                there are 27 states in which the death penalty is still legal.
