            <td style="width: 30%;">Operating system</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">An operating system is the software that controls the overall operation of a computer. It provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files, provides the interface by which a user can request the execution of programs, and provides the environment necessary to execute the programs requested.</td>

            <td style="width: 30%;">Multiprogramming</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">dividing time into short segments, each called a time slice (typically measured in milliseconds or microseconds), and then switching the CPU’s attention among the processes as each is allowed to execute for one time slice</td>

            <td style="width: 30%;">System software</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">the system software provides the infrastructure that the application software requires, in much the same manner as a nation’s infrastructure (government, roads, utilities, financial institutions, etc.) provides the foundation on which its citizens rely for their individual lifestyles.</td>

        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Utility software</td>

        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">More modern systems perform this task by means of a graphical user interface (GUI — pronounced “GOO–ee”) in which objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons.</td>

        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">

            <td style="width: 30%;">Kernel</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">An operating system’s kernel contains those software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Device driver</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">Another component of the kernel consists of a collection of device drivers, which are the software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times, directly with peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">File manager</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">the file manager maintains records of all the files stored in mass storage, including where each file is located, which users are allowed to access the various files, and which portions of mass storage are available for new files or extensions to existing files.</td>

        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Memory manager</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">Still another component of an operating system’s kernel is the memory manager, which is charged with the task of coordinating the machine’s use of main memory.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Virtual memory</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">the memory manager shuffles these pages back and forth between main memory and mass storage so that the pages that are needed at any given time are actually present in the 4GB of main memory. The result is that the computer is able to function as though it actually had 8GB of main memory. This large “fictional” memory space created by paging is called virtual memory.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Boot strapping</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;"> It is this procedure that transfers the operating system from mass storage (where it is permanently stored) into main memory (which is essentially empty when the machine is first turned on).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">ROM</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">a small portion of a computer’s main memory where the CPU expects to find its initial program is constructed from special nonvolatile memory cells. Such memory is known as read-only memory (ROM) because its contents can be read but not altered.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Deadlock</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">Another problem that can arise during resource allocation is deadlock, the condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Spooling</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">This technique of holding data for output at a later but more convenient time is called spooling.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Super user (or administrator)</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">Accounts are established by a person known as the super user or the administrator. This person gains highly privileged access to the operating system by identifying him- or herself as the administrator (usually by name and password) during the login procedure</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="background-color: #2f8ec9; text-align: center;">
            <td style="width: 30%;">Multi-factor authentication</td>
            <td style="width: 70%;">One solution to the pervasive problem of humans using weak password to secure their computer accounts is to require more than one piece of evidence to gain access. Passwords are an example of something that a user knows, along with the answers to commonly used security questions, such as “What is your maternal grandmother’s maiden name?” A second authentication factor might depend on something that the user has, such as an ATM card, a specialized security token, or a smartphone with a particular phone number. A growing number of online accounts require two-factor authentication, in which the user must provide a password, and also a special access code text messaged to the user’s smartphone during the login process.</td>
